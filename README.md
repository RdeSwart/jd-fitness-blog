## Agile Methodology

Using the Agile Methodology, I was able to plan and manage this project by breaking up the tasks into smaller, more manageable phases, which keeps the project focused and constantly progressing forward.

I used Github Issues to document user stories[see here](#link), where each user story contained an Acceptance criteria and the tasks detailed in order to fulfil that criteria.

To give prioritization, I used the [MoSCoW Method](#link-it-here). The acronym MoSCoW represents four categories of initiatives: must-have, should-have, could-have, and won't-have, or will not have right now. MORE ON THIS WHEN THEY WRITTEN!!


Here is the Kanban Board I used to keep everything in order ![screenshot of Kanban](link)


Review of agile method:

This was my first time using the agile method on my own project. As someone with ADHD, I found this such a great help to get my thoughts organised. It helped me manage my time better and prioritizing tasks, without getting distracted by the “look” or design was invaluable.

### Structure / Design

It was very important for the site to be responsive on most, if not all screen sizes, as JD Fitness wants the site to be available to users even when “on the go”. It is available on screens from 320px to 2560px sizes. This was made possible by using Bootstrap.????????

The navigation and Footer elements of the site are the same on every page to give a more uniform look.
